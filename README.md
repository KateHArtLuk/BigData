# BigData

Although the concept of big data itself is relatively new, the origins of large data sets go back to the 1960s and ‘70s when the world of data was just getting started with the first data centers and the development of the relational database.

**Big data benefits:**

* Big data makes it possible for you to gain more complete answers because you have more information.
* More complete answers mean more confidence in the data—which means a completely different approach to tackling problems.
